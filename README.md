## Data Cleaning
This dataset was loaded into PowerBI and was  mostly clean and needed little work.

## Data Analysis
Took some time to familiarise myself with the data understand what each column was describing to us and try and get a general sense of the dataset .In so doing I found an interesting tidibit of info to me about the first ever Airplane Crash!I included this info in my visual as I felt it was worth knowing and fitting on a research project as this .After I'd gotten good understanding of the data to my satisfaction and had come up with some ideas for insights we could draw from the data such as
which countries had the most plane crashes ,some of the causes of plane crashes with war being one of the top reasons.

## Data Visualization
Came up with visuals to match the insights I'd had in mind
